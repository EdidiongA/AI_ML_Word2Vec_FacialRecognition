# AI_ML_Word2Vec_FacialRecognition
The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms related to two applications – Google’s deep learning Word2vec word embeddings system and a facial recognition system using the UTK dataset.
The pre-trained Word2vec model (which is based on the Google News dataset) was obtained from https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/.
The UTK dataset was obtained from https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/
